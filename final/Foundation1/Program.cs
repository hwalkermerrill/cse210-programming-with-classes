// Exceeds requirements: Not only does this program satisfy the requirements of the task regarding holding the
// videos and comments, and not only did I use real comments and videos, but I also added a menu system and a
// way to open the videos in a web browser. Also, while we did not share code with each other, Michael Loftus
// and I did agree we would both use one of the same videos, and we looked up how to open a video in a web 
// browser together in class, so if your wondering why there may be some similarity (I don't know what his code
// looks like or if he chickened out of the joke), that is why. I also did double the required number of videos.
