Formatted Copy of rubric:
Note, all things must use correct naming convention
(like attributes using _camelCase) and properties are not allowed.

Criteria	-----  Pts  -----	 Rating  -----  Description
Principle: Abstraction
  20 pts
  Complete
  The program is divided into classes with a single responsibility.

  14 pts
  Developing
  The program uses classes throughout, but some classes are too large and complex and their behaviors should be further separated into smaller classes.

  0 pts
  Incomplete
  The program makes only minimal use of classes.

Principle: Encapsulation
  20 pts
  Complete
  All member variables are private (or protected if specifically needed in a derived class), and public methods are defined for necessary behaviors. Classes manage their own information.

  14 pts
  Developing
  Encapsulation is used appropriately in most places.

  0 pts
  Incomplete
  Minimal attempt at encapsulation is made (for example, public member variables are accessed in various places in the program).

Principle: Inheritance
  20 pts
  Complete
  All behaviors and attributes, shared among multiple related classes, are placed in a base class and inherited.

  14 pts
  Developing
  Inheritance is used in the program.

  0 pts
  Incomplete
  Inheritance is not used in the program.

Principle: Polymorphism
  20 pts
  Complete
  Method overriding is used where appropriate.

  14 pts
  Developing
  At least one method from a base class is correctly overriden.

  0 pts
  Incomplete
  Method overriding is not used in the program.

Functionality: Program Runs
  20 pts
  Complete
  For the Open-ended version: The program runs without runtime errors. For the Foundation 4 version: All four programs run without errors.

  18 pts
  Nearly Complete
  For the Open-ended version: The program runs initially, but OCCASIONAL runtime errors exist during execution. For the Foundation 4 version: At least three of the programs contain more than the "Hello World" code and run.

  10 pts
  Developing
  For the Open-ended version: The program runs initially, but FREQUENT runtime errors exist during execution. For the Foundation 4 version: At least two of the programs contain more than the "Hello World" code and run.

  5 pts
  Attempted
  For the Foundation 4 version: At least one of the programs contains more than the "Hello World" code and runs.

  0 pts
  Incomplete
  The program does not run.

Functionality: Program can be played
  80 pts
  Complete
  For the Open-ended version: The core functionality of the program is present. For the Foundation 4 version: At least three of the programs work correctly.

  67 pts
  Nearly Complete
  For the Open-ended version: Some user interaction is present that is consistent with the desired functionality. For the Foundation 4 version: At least two of the programs work correctly.

  40 pts
  Developing
  For the Open-ended version: Some user interaction is present that is consistent with the desired functionality. For the Foundation 4 version: At least two of the programs work correctly.

  20 pts
  Attempted
  For the Open-ended version: The program displays content that resembles the desired output. For the Foundation 4 version: At least one of the programs works correctly.

  0 pts
  Incomplete
  The program has minimal interaction or functionality.

Style: Whitespace
  10 pts
  Complete
  Vertical and horizontal whitespace (blank lines, indentation, braces) is correct throughout the program (fewer than 3 errors).

  7.5 pts
  Nearly Complete
  Whitespace is generally correct, but a few errors exist (3-6 errors)

  5 pts
  Developing
  Whitespace is generally correct, but many errors exist (more than 6 errors).

  0 pts
  Incomplete
  Very little attention is shown to vertical and horizontal whitespace.

Style: Naming Conventions
  10 pts
  Complete
  Classes and methods use TitleCase, member variables use _underscoreCamelCase, local variables use camelCase.

  7.5 pts
  Nearly Complete
  Naming is generally correct, but a few errors exist (3-6 errors).

  5 pts
  Developing
  Naming is generally correct, but many errors exist (more than 6 errors).

  0 pts
  Incomplete
  Naming is inconsistent.
